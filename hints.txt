1. Metamask browser extension was injecting some unwanted networks.
So it should be disabled during the development process (or it must be connected with a local geth instance)


2. Private network `truffle deploy` might not work without an explicit gas limit

3. During contract deployment plain account unlocking might be insufficient.
Time in seconds should be submitted to keep the accounts open long enough.

```
personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0], "<your password>", 15000)
```

4. Events do not work via RPC. Only web socket provider is required for that.

I subscribed to the event but it was not working. The callback was never called. Then I found out that I needed to activate the WebSockets server (--ws and similar in geth).
Found it in this Ethereum Stack Exchange Post
